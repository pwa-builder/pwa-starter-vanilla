# pwa-starter-vanilla

Welcome to the plain JavaScript edition of the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) pwa-starter! Are you a beginner to web development and looking to build a new [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)? This is what you are looking for! The pwa-starter-vanilla includes everything you need to start building your first PWA.

## Getting Started

### Prequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Recommended Development setup

We recommend the following tools for your dev setup:

* Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or [hyper](https://hyper.is/)
* VSCode extension: [PWABuilder VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PWABuilder.pwabuilder-extension)

### Development

Run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`, the starter should open in your default browser. From here you can start developing, your changes will be rebuilt and reloaded in the browser as you develop.

## Deployment and Packaging

### Deployment

Once your PWA is ready to deploy we recommend [Azure static site hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) for deploying your PWA.


### Packaging

Many app stores, including the Microsoft Store and the Google Play Store support PWAs. To package your PWA for deployment to these app stores head back to https://pwabuilder.com/, put in your URL and hit `Build My PWA`.
